1. Incorrect channel names 

-   The dashboard expects specifc channel names to work correctly. Please go into your csv and edit your channel names to match the following:

    channel1_410 = ACC control data column 
    channel2_410 = ACC signal data column 
    channel1_470 = ADN control data column 
    channel2_470 = ADN signal data column 
    DI/O-1 = Digital input/output signal to mark the start of the behavioural data. Used to synchronise the photometry and behavioural data.

-    The original use case of the dash was to compare ADN and ACC, but you can look at any 2 parts of the brain

2. Incorrect file structure

    The dashboard expects that your data files are structured as follows
    │-- data/                    
│   ├── mousename_group/              
│   │   ├── mousename_recording.csv      # Photometry data
│   │   ├── mousename_behavior.csv      # Behavioral classification
│   ├── mouse2/              # Additional datasets

-   How you name the mouse files matters. The folder containing an individual mouses data should be named mousename_group, where mouse name is their id and group is the experimental condition or group they are apart of. If you are testing the same mice at different timepoints you can indicate this with their group name. Ex. h149_remote.csv vs. h149_recent.csv. They will be treated as indivdual mice by the dashboard and you can compare them by assigning them to separate groups and analyzing them on the group page. 
-   Each mouse folder must contain two files, one for the photometry data and one from the behavioural deeplab classification. Follow the format above for naming each file. Ex. h149_recording.csv and h149_behavior.csv. 

3. Excluding a mouse from the group analysis

- To exclude mice from the group analysis either do not assign them a group on their individual mouse page or add a new group called "Exclude" and assign the mice you'd like to exclude to that group. 

4. Slow dashboard

-   The dashboard is a bit slow. This is because of how we are loading and processing the data. If the tab of the window says **"Updating.."**, then please be patient and wait for it to finish updating, it should only take 5-15 seconds.
